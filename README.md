# -File-Search-Engine-Using-Java
This project is a Java-based search engine that allows users to search for files within a specified directory. It leverages Java NIO's Files.walkFileTree to recursively traverse directories and locate files based on user input. The program efficiently handles symbolic links and includes robust error handling mechanisms.
